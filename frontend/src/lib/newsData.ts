    content: 'Coimbatore, \n In a bid to strengthen security and curb crime, the Coimbatore City Police will install 1,400 new surveillance cameras across the city. Police Commissioner A. Saravana Sundar announced the initiative on Monday, stating that the move forms part of measures to enhance public safety and improve visible policing.\n\nThe cameras will be installed in vulnerable and isolated areas, particularly around vacant lands, entry and exit points, and crime-prone localities. The decision follows the recent abduction and gang-rape of a 20-year-old college student near Brindhavan Nagar, close to the city airport.\n\nAt present, the city has 700 police-installed CCTV cameras. The Commissioner noted that numerous cameras set up by private residents and business establishments were found to be non-functional. He urged the public to ensure that their surveillance systems remain active and properly maintained.\n\nRegular patrolling has contributed to a decline in assault-related cases this year. We will further intensify police presence in all parts of the city, Mr. Sundar said.\n\nPolice personnel had patrolled Brindhavan Nagar on the day of the crime, according to officials. However, the offence occurred in a deserted plot along a mud road connecting Brindhavan Nagar and SIHS Colony.\n\nCoimbatore currently operates 59 two-wheeler beat patrol units and 25 GPS-enabled patrol vehicles. The Peelamedu police, under whose jurisdiction the incident took place, have five beat units and two patrol cars.\n\nInstructions have been issued to step up night patrolling along the Brindhavan Nagar–SIHS Colony stretch and similar isolated routes.\n\nAuthorities said the expanded camera network and intensified patrolling efforts aim to provide enhanced safety to residents and deter criminal elements.',

    excerpt: 'The Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation\'s ambitious ₹200-crore project to rejuvenate the Noyyal River has drawn criticism from environmentalists.',
    content: 'Coimbatore:\nThe Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation\'s ambitious ₹200-crore project to rejuvenate the Noyyal River has drawn criticism from environmentalists, who say the initiative focuses more on beautification than on tackling sewage and pollution at the source.The project covers an 18.5-km stretch of the river within city limits and includes desilting, strengthening of river bunds, construction of two sewage treatment plants (4 MLD each), and diversion channels linking drains to existing treatment facilities. Plans also include a 4.5-km riverfront road from Athupalam to Nanjundapuram Road, development of four parks, and other landscaping works.Environmental activists argue that while the beautification plans may boost the riverfront\'s aesthetics, they fail to address untreated sewage discharge, the primary cause of the river\'s degradation. Activist K. Mohanraj pointed out that with a population exceeding 22 lakh and average per capita water use of 135 litres a day, Coimbatore generates vast quantities of domestic wastewater. Expanding existing sewage treatment capacity and preventing untreated waste from entering the Noyyal should be the top priority, he said, adding that the proposed treatment capacity may not be sufficient for long-term needs.Another activist, K. Selvaganesh, cautioned against the use of exotic plants such as Conocarpus along bunds, noting that such species harm local biodiversity and provide little support for pollinators and migratory birds. Native species should be planted to restore ecological balance, he added.A senior Corporation official defended the project, stating that the beautification works would primarily use native vegetation and minimal concrete to stabilize the bunds. Exotic species, the official clarified, would be planted only in adjacent park areas. The official also said that sewage currently enters the Noyyal at 41 points, and the proposed treatment facilities would be adequate for the next decade. By then, the city is expected to achieve full coverage under the underground drainage system.The detailed project report for the Noyyal rejuvenation plan is expected to be completed within a week.',

    content: 'Coimbatore, long celebrated as the Manchester of South India, is now commanding fresh attention as one of the country\'s fastest-growing real estate destinations. What began as a textile-driven industrial town has evolved into a diversified economic hub, home to over 25,000 manufacturing, engineering, jewellery, poultry, and IT enterprises — a transformation that is now directly translating into soaring property values.\n\nThis growth story is powered by a rare blend of industrial strength, strategic infrastructure investments, and superior liveability. Remarkably, Coimbatore continues to rank among India\'s least-polluted urban centres, offering a quality of life unmatched in most fast-growing cities.\n\nA recent JLL study positions Coimbatore among India\'s top affordable investment markets — a compelling signal for value-seeking buyers and institutional investors alike. The impact is visible along emerging corridors and suburban belts, particularly near major highways, where land appreciation is accelerating.\n\nSmart City Vision Converts to Real-World Value:  As one of the first 20 cities chosen under India\'s Smart Cities Mission, Coimbatore has benefited from targeted upgrades across mobility, utilities, sustainability, and digital governance. These strategic investments have strengthened the city\'s reputation as a well-planned, future-ready urban centre — a key determinant for modern investors seeking long-term, stable growth markets.\n\nAirport Expansion: A Catalyst for Capital Flows:  A ₹2,000-crore expansion of Coimbatore International Airport represents a pivotal milestone in the city\'s growth trajectory. With 90% of land acquisition already complete, the expansion will unlock enhanced domestic and international connectivity, positioning Coimbatore for heightened investment inflows across sectors from global manufacturing to hospitality.\n\nReal estate activity around the airport corridor has already begun reflecting the shift, with rising demand and price appreciation.',

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has floated a tender for constructing a precast boundary wall on newly acquired land and simultaneously unveiled a tentative master plan for the project.\n\nThe boundary wall, estimated at ₹29 crore, will stretch 16.7 km and is expected to be completed within 456 days. This marks the first visible step in a comprehensive infrastructure expansion that aims to transform Coimbatore\'s aviation ecosystem over the next few years.\n\nTwo-Phase Expansion with Major Capacity Boost : The expansion blueprint covers construction of a new passenger terminal, cargo terminal, and ATC-cum-technical block, to be executed in two phases. A key highlight is the extension of the existing runway from 2,990 metres to 3,810 metres, enabling the airport to handle long-haul international flights and high-capacity aircraft.\n\nSignificant terminal upgrades are planned:\nAerobridges: Rising from 4 to 20\nRunway length: Expanding to 3,810 m\nOperational efficiency: Additional aprons and ramp systems to support higher aircraft movement\n\nThe master plan also proposes urban-scale amenities such as a dedicated bus terminal, multi-level car park, new approach road, and hospitality facilities including two mid-scale hotels and one premium hotel — underscoring a future-ready aerocity concept.',

    content: 'Coimbatore:\nCoimbatore\'s real estate market is entering a defining growth phase, powered by a sharp rise in NRI confidence and capital inflows. Over the past year, housing demand from the Indian diaspora has surged by 35%, signalling a strategic shift toward high-potential tier-2 cities that offer value, infrastructure depth, and long-term livability.\n\nAt the heart of this momentum is a sweeping infrastructure upgrade redefining the urban landscape. The 139-km metro rail network — slated for completion by 2027 — will fundamentally transform mobility and unlock new investment corridors. Flyovers across key arterial routes such as Avinashi Road are already easing congestion and enabling seamless urban movement. These developments are not merely easing commutes; they are reshaping growth patterns and fast-tracking suburban emergence.\n\nNeighbourhoods like Saravanampatti, Thudiyalur, and Vadavalli are evolving into preferred residential and commercial clusters. Their proximity to IT hubs such as TIDEL Park, along with industrial ecosystems and cleaner, more spacious living environments, has positioned them as lifestyle-driven growth pockets. For NRIs, these areas tick both boxes — future appreciation and immediate quality-of-life benefits.\n\nPrice competitiveness remains a compelling advantage in Coimbatore\'s value proposition. Unlike Chennai or Bengaluru, the city offers premium real estate formats at significantly more accessible price points. Buyers can access integrated communities, gated enclaves, and smart-enabled homes without the inflation seen in metro markets. Demand spans 2BHK and 3BHK apartments as well as plotted developments, while affordable luxury — blending wellness features, smart technology, and community amenities — is steadily rising in appeal.',

    content: 'Coimbatore\'s century-old Lakshmi Mills, once the pulsating heart of South India\'s textile industry, has been reborn as a vibrant urban and retail destination. The transformation of this iconic 12-acre campus from a historic mill complex into a contemporary mixed-use hub marks a defining moment in Coimbatore\'s urban renewal journey.Originally established as one of India\'s pioneering textile hubs, Lakshmi Mills had long symbolized the entrepreneurial spirit of Tamil Nadu. Today, it stands at the crossroads of heritage and innovation, seamlessly blending industrial history with a modern commercial ecosystem.The redevelopment project, designed by architecture firm Studio Lotus under Ambrish Arora and Siddharth Talwar, began in phased expansions starting in 2021. With the first phase completed in 2023 and the second in 2024, the ongoing third phase continues to elevate the site\'s status as one of the most dynamic lifestyle and business centers in the city.Studio Lotus\' approach has been rooted in adaptive reuse. The architects retained much of the original structural character—brick facades, industrial detailing, and spatial layouts—integrating them with sustainable materials and modern climate-responsive techniques. Their vision: to make Lakshmi Mills both timeless and future-ready.Today, the redeveloped complex spans 125,000 square feet, hosting global retail brands, Coimbatore\'s first Starbucks, and curated cultural arenas. The site also features open-air food parks, landscaped pedestrian corridors, and social zones designed to foster community interaction.Footfalls tell the story of success. While weekdays attract between 2,500 and 3,500 visitors, weekends see this number surge to around 10,000. Businesses within the complex have reported sales growth surpassing initial projections by 15–20 percent. Enhanced parking facilities and integrated transport connectivity have further cemented its position as a premier city destination.Beyond its commercial footprint, Lakshmi Mills is a case study in sustainable urban transformation—demonstrating how dormant industrial assets can be reprogrammed into socially vibrant and economically resilient spaces. It represents not just the revival of a mill, but the redefinition of Coimbatore\'s identity as a forward-looking metropolis where history and modernity co-exist in harmony.',

They have conducted over 100 workshops across the city, training merchants on using various digital payment platforms.\n\nKey factors driving this adoption include the ease of transaction, reduced cash handling costs, and better record-keeping capabilities. Many merchants have also noted that younger customers prefer digital payments, and accepting these methods has helped them attract more footfall.\n\nThe State Bank of India has reported that Coimbatore ranks among the top 10 cities in Tamil Nadu for digital payment transactions. The bank has installed over 500 new POS machines across the city in the past year to support this growing trend.\n\nLocal businesses are also leveraging digital payment data to better understand customer preferences and optimize their inventory accordingly.
