        content: `Coimbatore:
The Coimbatore International Airport has registered an 11 percent growth in passenger traffic, handling 17.6 lakh flyers between April and September this financial year, according to data from the Airports Authority of India (AAI).

The airport had recorded over 30 lakh passengers in 2024, despite being designed for an annual capacity of 20 lakh. It now handles more than 30 departures a day, including domestic flights to major cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Goa, and Ahmedabad, and international services to Singapore, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah.

The Kongu Global Forum (KGF), a consortium of business and industrial leaders from Tamil Nadus western districts, urged the authorities to draw up an interim plan to enhance the airports handling capacity. It also sought additional flights on busy domestic routes and new international services to Colombo, Bangkok, Dubai, and Doha.

Airport Director G. Sambath Kumar said that construction of a compound wall around the land recently transferred by the State government to the AAI is progressing and expected to be completed by September 2026. The wall will have a total length of about 16 kilometres.`,

        content: `Coimbatore, long celebrated as the Manchester of South India, is now commanding fresh attention as one of the country\'s fastest-growing real estate destinations. What began as a textile-driven industrial town has evolved into a diversified economic hub, home to over 25,000 manufacturing, engineering, jewellery, poultry, and IT enterprises — a transformation that is now directly translating into soaring property values.

This growth story is powered by a rare blend of industrial strength, strategic infrastructure investments, and superior liveability. Remarkably, Coimbatore continues to rank among India\'s least-polluted urban centres, offering a quality of life unmatched in most fast-growing cities.

A recent JLL study positions Coimbatore among India\'s top affordable investment markets — a compelling signal for value-seeking buyers and institutional investors alike. The impact is visible along emerging corridors and suburban belts, particularly near major highways, where land appreciation is accelerating.

Smart City Vision Converts to Real-World Value: As one of the first 20 cities chosen under India\'s Smart Cities Mission, Coimbatore has benefited from targeted upgrades across mobility, utilities, sustainability, and digital governance. These strategic investments have strengthened the city\'s reputation as a well-planned, future-ready urban centre — a key determinant for modern investors seeking long-term, stable growth markets.

Airport Expansion: A Catalyst for Capital Flows: A ₹2,000-crore expansion of Coimbatore International Airport represents a pivotal milestone in the city\'s growth trajectory. With 90% of land acquisition already complete, the expansion will unlock enhanced domestic and international connectivity, positioning Coimbatore for heightened investment inflows across sectors from global manufacturing to hospitality.

Real estate activity around the airport corridor has already begun reflecting the shift, with rising demand and price appreciation.`,
